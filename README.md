# Guybrush

This was the first of two examples I used to teach my first JavaFX workshop. This example covers:

- adding nodes to the scene graph
- event handling
- animation

In case you're wondering: the example is named after Guybrush Threepwood, the main character in the classic Monkey Island series of adventure games. These games are still for sale on the App Store, GOG and Steam and I suggest you go buy them!

This repository contains a NetBeans project. It was last tested using NetBeans 8.0.2 and JDK 8u25.
